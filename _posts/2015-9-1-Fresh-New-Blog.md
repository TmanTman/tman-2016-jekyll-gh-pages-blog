title: Fresh New Blog
---

Gotta love the smell of a fresh blog, right?

Why create this blog, and the landing page? I needed some place they could
see who I am and what I do, and that exactly what my landing page is for. Every time I get a invitation on LinkedIn or a pageview on about.me, or someone interacts with me using Google+, I feel like I'm letting those people down. People want to go there to see who I am or what I do, but I don't spend my time on keeping those profiles interesting and making them appealing.

Why not just use the social media sites? I spend my time doing really interesting things that show results, or I have fun. And making a habit of keeping my online profiles up to date just hasn't quite come close to being exciting enough to take up any time in any of the former two categories.

The blog then? During development, I come across some designs/patterns/functions that work really well, and I like to
concisely write it out, both for myself and for other who are searching for it. I've tried other blogs - Blogger, Wordpress, etc
but it's just always been a struggle.

Finally, I came across Jekyll. It just fits in perfectly with what I need and the skills I've developed, and I really love it.

Hence, I built my landing page and the blog, all designed by myself (I've been wanting to do some design for a while now!)

Looking forward to writing more stuff here, and improving on the design of the website!
