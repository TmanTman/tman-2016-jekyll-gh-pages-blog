title: Functional Programming and classes
---

Object-orientated programming is defined to have classes and objects. Functional programming
is defined to adhere to mathematical laws by not allowing for
immutable variables, and building programs entirely on functions. Data collections
are associated with a flatMap (or bind) and unit method, which allows for monad operations on
the collection.

But then I rewatch the Functional Programming course by Martin Odersky and I realise that Scala also has
classes and objects. Which is kind of boggled mind.

So in the intro of the course, Martin Odersky mentions that OOP programming is orthoganal to
the imperative, functional and logical programming, which now kind of makes sense.

Functional programming stands opposite of Imperative programming. Functional programming does
not allow for mutable variables, and does not depend on side effects to write a program. Imperative
programming uses side effects extensively to achieve control of a program.

Super important distinction right there. Functional does not oppose the use of classes and objects.
Functional opposes the use of mutable variables, therefore it stands opposite to Imperative programming.
