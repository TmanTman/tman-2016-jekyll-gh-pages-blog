title: Testing promises Angular
---

Unit testing pure functions is easy enough: For a given input, you expect a given
output. But testing with mocks and promises complicates it a bit.

Firstly, define what you mean by testing promise. One of two scenarios is possible:

1. You can inject a promise and, from your unit tests, either reject or resolve the promise
2. The function you're testing returns a promise, and you have to make sure that if a given
behaviour in the function executes, that the promise will resolve or reject.

I'll update the post once I take another break. Remind me if I forget and you need to know.
