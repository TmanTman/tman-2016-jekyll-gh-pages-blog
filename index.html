                Makes it possible to remotely discuss things with someone while using
                images and drawings to aid the discussion. On mobile or computer. Gamechanger for students, and other industries.
                Will quickly grow to also do better messaging for visual-based work.

                There is incredible opportunity for combining engineering and
                start-up entrepreneurship to innovate in the electricity industry.
                I'll commence my high-voltage training in 2016.
